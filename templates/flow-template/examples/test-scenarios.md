# Flow Testing Scenarios

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive test scenarios for validating flow functionality across different use cases and edge conditions.

## Test Environment Setup
- **Org Type**: Developer/Sandbox
- **Required Data**: Test accounts, contacts, custom objects
- **User Permissions**: Flow execution permissions, object access
- **Debug Mode**: Enabled for detailed troubleshooting

---

## Test Scenario 1: Happy Path Testing

### Objective
Validate the flow works correctly under normal conditions with valid data.

### Prerequisites
- Flow is activated
- User has required permissions
- Test records exist in the system

### Test Steps
1. **Setup Test Data**
   ```
   Account Record:
   - Name: "Test Account - Happy Path"
   - Type: "Customer"
   - Annual Revenue: $500,000
   - Industry: "Technology"
   ```

2. **Execute Flow**
   - Trigger: [Describe trigger condition]
   - Input: Account ID from step 1
   - Expected Processing: Record validation → Processing → Update → Notification

3. **Verify Results**
   - [ ] Flow completes successfully
   - [ ] Record is updated with expected values
   - [ ] Notification is sent
   - [ ] Output variables contain correct values
   - [ ] No errors in debug logs

### Expected Outcomes
- **Processing Result**: "Record processed successfully"
- **Record Updates**: Description field updated with "Processed by Flow"
- **Notifications**: Email sent to configured recipients
- **Performance**: Flow completes within 30 seconds

## Test Scenario 2: Edge Case Testing

### Objective
Test flow behavior with boundary values and edge conditions.

### Test Cases

#### 2.1 Empty/Null Values
```
Test Data:
- Record ID: Valid ID
- Name: null/empty
- Required Fields: Missing values
- Numeric Fields: 0, negative values
```

**Expected Behavior**: Flow should handle gracefully with appropriate error messages

#### 2.2 Maximum Values
```
Test Data:
- Name: 255 character string (field limit)
- Annual Revenue: Maximum possible value
- Collection Size: 200 records (bulk processing limit)
```

**Expected Behavior**: Flow processes without errors or respects governor limits

#### 2.3 Special Characters
```
Test Data:
- Name: "Test & Company <Special> Characters!"
- Description: Unicode characters: 日本語 العربية
- Email: "test+special@domain.com"
```

**Expected Behavior**: Special characters are preserved and handled correctly

## Test Scenario 3: Error Handling

### Objective
Validate flow error handling and recovery mechanisms.

### Test Cases

#### 3.1 Invalid Record ID
```
Input: Non-existent or invalid record ID
Expected: Error handling path activated
Result: Appropriate error message, no system crash
```

#### 3.2 Permission Errors
```
Setup: User without required object permissions
Expected: Permission error caught and handled
Result: User-friendly error message displayed
```

#### 3.3 Validation Rule Failures
```
Setup: Record update violates validation rules
Expected: Validation error caught
Result: Flow continues with alternative path
```

#### 3.4 Integration Failures (if applicable)
```
Setup: External system unavailable
Expected: Timeout/connection error handling
Result: Retry mechanism or graceful failure
```

---

## Test Scenario 4: Performance Testing

### Objective
Validate flow performance under various load conditions.

### Test Cases

#### 4.1 Single Record Processing
```
Data Volume: 1 record
Expected Time: < 5 seconds
CPU Usage: Minimal
SOQL Queries: < 5
```

#### 4.2 Bulk Processing
```
Data Volume: 200 records (governor limit)
Expected Time: < 60 seconds
CPU Usage: Within limits
SOQL Queries: Efficient bulk patterns
```

#### 4.3 Complex Processing
```
Scenario: Multiple object updates, callouts, calculations
Expected: All governor limits respected
Result: No limit exceptions thrown
```

---

## Test Scenario 5: User Interface Testing (Screen Flows)

### Objective
Validate screen flow user experience and interface functionality.

### Test Cases

#### 5.1 Screen Display Testing
- [ ] **Desktop View**: Proper layout on large screens
- [ ] **Mobile View**: Responsive design works correctly
- [ ] **Tablet View**: Medium screen optimization
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatibility

#### 5.2 Input Validation Testing
```
Test Inputs:
- Required fields left empty
- Invalid email formats
- Numeric fields with text input
- Date fields with invalid dates
```

**Expected**: Validation messages appear, user cannot proceed

#### 5.3 Navigation Testing
- [ ] **Next Button**: Progresses to next screen after validation
- [ ] **Back Button**: Returns to previous screen with data preserved
- [ ] **Cancel Button**: Exits flow with confirmation
- [ ] **Finish Button**: Completes flow and shows results

#### 5.4 Dynamic Display Testing
```
Scenarios:
- Conditional field visibility based on selections
- Dynamic picklist values based on other fields
- Show/hide sections based on user role
```

---

## Test Scenario 6: Integration Testing

### Objective
Test flow integration with external systems and other Salesforce components.

### Test Cases

#### 6.1 API Callout Testing (if applicable)
```
External System: [System Name]
Test Cases:
- Successful API response
- API timeout handling
- Invalid authentication
- Malformed response handling
```

#### 6.2 Email Integration Testing
```
Email Templates: Test with various templates
Recipients: Single and multiple recipients
Content: Dynamic content population
Attachments: File attachment handling (if applicable)
```

#### 6.3 Other Flow Integration
```
Scenario: Flow calls other flows (subflows)
Test Cases:
- Successful subflow execution
- Subflow error handling
- Data passing between flows
- Performance impact of nested flows
```

---

## Test Scenario 7: Security Testing

### Objective
Validate flow security and permission handling.

### Test Cases

#### 7.1 Object-Level Security
```
Test Users:
- User with full access
- User with read-only access
- User with no access
Expected: Appropriate error handling for insufficient permissions
```

#### 7.2 Field-Level Security
```
Test Scenarios:
- Hidden fields in flow screens
- Read-only fields in updates
- Required fields user cannot see
Expected: Graceful handling without exposing restricted data
```

#### 7.3 Record-Level Security
```
Test Cases:
- Records user owns
- Records user doesn't own (sharing rules)
- Records with restricted access
Expected: Respects sharing model and access controls
```
